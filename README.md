# KFQuake
***I retain no rights to this work as I did not create the original mod, I made this because I enjoy Kickflip Quake too much to leave minor annoyances in.***

The original source code written by Michael 'Squirt' Buettner can be found at https://www.moddb.com/mods/kickflip-quake/downloads/source-code.

## Source Code Changes

*- Removed the loss of stamina entirely.*

*- Removed the loss of health while taking damage (currently instaheals you, I would like to make it only deal damage if enemies hit you, with tricks and fall damage doing nothing. I'm still limited in my understanding of this mod's source code though, so expect nothing*

*- Removed the credits message that displayed anytime a level was loaded. Credits to Squirt have been moved to the Help message (viewed by pressing F1).*

*- Changed the Help message to credit Squirt and provide instructions on how to rebind keys.*

*- You no longer instantly die in water, slime, or lava.*
