# KFQuake
***THIS IS NOT A REWRITE NOR WILL IT FUNDEMENTALLY CHANGE HOW KICKFLIP QUAKE WORKS. I retain no rights to this work as I did not create the original mod, I made this because I enjoy Kickflip Quake too much to leave minor annoyances in. Free Melee.***

The original source code written by Michael 'Squirt' Buettner can be found at https://www.moddb.com/mods/kickflip-quake/downloads/source-code.

## Source Code Changes

*- Removed the loss of stamina entirely.*

*- Removed the loss of health when failing a trick or falling from height (you can still lose health by being shot or falling in a hazardous liquid.)*

*- Removed the credits message that displayed anytime a level was loaded. Credits to Squirt have been moved to the Help message (viewed by pressing F1.)*

*- Changed the Help message to credit Squirt and provide instructions on how to rebind keys.*

*- You no longer instantly die in water, slime, or lava.*

*- Removed the penalty for not looking in the direction you're moving when landing.*

## Justifications for each change to the source.

It is highly unlikely that *anyone* has spent as much time in this mod as I have, as such, I feel like I understand well what makes this mod great. I will not fundementally be changing what makes Kickflip Quake what it is, because in my opinion it's already fantastic. It's not an alternative to THPS, it's entirely a freestyle mod which encourages creativity over score. The score is still useless for this reason. Below are my justifications to each change in the source code.

`- Removed the loss of stamina entirely.`

Stamina has no reason to exist in this mod, it's an annoying feature that gets in the way of some tricks while not affecting others.

`- Removed the loss of health when failing a trick or falling from height (you can still lose health by being shot or falling in a hazardous liquid.)`

This also rarely comes into play, and is annoying. Your actual rate of healing is unaffected, you will still take normal damage from normal sources and will regenerate at the mod's intended rate.

`- Removed the credits message that displayed anytime a level was loaded. Credits to Squirt have been moved to the Help message (viewed by pressing F1.)`

This mod is over two decades old at this point, and credits to Squirt remain in the game via the Help command. The issue is how long this message was on screen, you would have to wait it out everytime a level was loaded. I did not like this, and I don't know anyone that did. I don't imagine Squirt still cares, wherever he is.

`- Changed the Help message to credit Squirt and provide instructions on how to rebind keys.`

Exactly what's written on the tin, the Help menu is now a bit more fleshed out. It was very annoying to learn how to bind keys before, that should no longer be the case.

`- You no longer instantly die in water, slime, or lava.`

You still take damage from slime and lava, water is still a bit odd to move in. I didn't see a reason for this to exist honestly.

`- Removed the penalty for not looking in the direction you're moving when landing.`

This is the most drastic change in my opinion. I believe it to be good though, it unlocks an interesting new piece of tech and makes certain tricks a bit more viable. It's also nice to not accidentally trigger this.
