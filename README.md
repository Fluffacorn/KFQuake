# KFQuake
***THIS IS NOT A REWRITE NOR WILL IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE HOW KICKFLIP QUAKE WORKS.*** *I retain no rights to this work as I did not create the original mod, I made this because I enjoy Kickflip Quake too much to leave minor annoyances in. Note that this was designed with FTEQuake in mind, and all releases will be intended for use with it. I will not provide assistance for other clients, I simply don't have the time to.*


**Make sure to check the Wiki tab on this github page! It contains useful information.**

***Free Melee.***

**~~Add Bot~~**| **~~B~~**

**Don't enable the Add Bot bind, it is very, very unstable. It's disabled by default and commented out in the autoexec for a reason.**

## How to change keybinds

**These instructions for changing keybinds are directly applicable to FTEQuake, this guide is not intended for people using other engines. You can definitely change them in those engines, but I will not be the one providing a tutorial on how to do so.**

* Navigate to the KFQuake folder and find the `Autoexec.cfg` file. Open it in your text editor of choice.

* Change the keys under **//Skate Binds** to fit the layout you want.

* ***DO NOT CHANGE THE SKATE ALIASES. These are vital for the mod to work, no one should ever need to change these.***

## Compiling from source.

There's a good chance you're smarter than me, maybe you can fix something broken. This is compiled in the same way as all other Quake 1 mods, I personally use FTEQCC which can be found at https://fte.triptohell.info. 

## Extra stuff :)

To hide the HUD, enter the `sizeup` command in Quake until the HUD disappears.
