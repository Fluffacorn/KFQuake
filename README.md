# KFQuake
***I retain no rights to this work as I did not create the original mod, I made this because I enjoy Kickflip Quake too much to leave minor annoyances in.***

The original source code written by Michael 'Squirt' Buettner can be found at https://www.moddb.com/mods/kickflip-quake/downloads/source-code.

## Source Code Changes

*- Removed the loss of stamina entirely.*

*- Removed the loss of health from failing a trick or falling from a large height. (you can still fail a trick and will be interrupted if you fall from a large height, you just won't take damage anymore).*

*- Removed the credits message that displayed anytime a level was loaded. Credits to Squirt have been moved to the Help message (viewed by pressing F1).*

*- Changed the Help message to credit Squirt and provide instructions on how to rebind keys.*

*- You no longer instantly die in water, slime, or lava.*
