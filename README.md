***A mod to change the small flaws in Kickflip Quake*** 

*I made this because I enjoy Kickflip Quake too much to leave it's simple flaws in place. Note that this was designed with  [FTEQuake](https://fte.triptohell.info/downloads "Download it here!") in mind, and all releases are intended for use with it. I will not provide assistance for other clients, I simply don't have the time to.*

[**All known tech can be viewed on the wiki page, along with the changes I've made to the mod**](https://github.com/Fluffacorn/KFQuake/wiki)

***Free Melee.***

The original source code written by Michael 'Squirt' Buettner can be found at https://www.moddb.com/mods/kickflip-quake/downloads/source-code.

## Default controls

Command  | Keybind
------------- | -------------
Help  | F1
Trick 1 (Indy Grab)  | Shift
Trick 2 (Pop Shove-it)  | Q
Trick 3 (360 Shove-it)  | E
Trick 4 (Backside 360)  | R
Toggle Cam (First Person)  | C
Competition Start | M
**~~Add Bot~~**| **~~B~~**

**Don't enable the Add Bot bind, it is very, very unstable. It's disabled by default and commented out in the autoexec for a reason.**

## How to change keybinds and preferences

**These instructions for changing keybinds are directly applicable to FTEQuake, this guide is not intended for people using other engines. You can definitely change them in those engines, but I will not be the one providing a tutorial on how to do so.**

* Navigate to the KFQuake folder and find the `Autoexec.cfg` file. Open it in your text editor of choice.

* Change the keys under **// Skate Binds** to fit the key layout you want.

* Change the values under **// Tweaks** to fit your preferences.

* ***DO NOT CHANGE THE SKATE ALIASES. These are vital for the mod to work, no one should ever need to change these.***

## Compiling from source.

There's a good chance you're smarter than me, maybe you can fix something broken. This is compiled in the same way as all other Quake 1 mods, I personally use FTEQCC which can be found at https://fte.triptohell.info.
